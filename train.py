You can call `.numpy()` on the `image_batch` and `labels_batch` tensors to convert them to a `numpy.ndarray`.

## Configure the dataset for performance

Let's make sure to use buffered prefetching so you can yield data from disk without having I/O become blocking. These are two important methods you should use when loading data:

- `Dataset.cache` keeps the images in memory after they're loaded off disk during the first epoch. This will ensure the dataset does not become a bottleneck while training your model. If your dataset is too large to fit into memory, you can also use this method to create a performant on-disk cache.
- `Dataset.prefetch` overlaps data preprocessing and model execution while training.

Interested readers can learn more about both methods, as well as how to cache data to disk in the *Prefetching* section of the [Better performance with the tf.data API](../../guide/data_performance.ipynb) guide.

The [Sequential](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model) model consists of three convolution blocks (`tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`) with a max pooling layer (`tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D`) in each of them. There's a fully-connected layer (`tf.keras.layers.Dense`) with 128 units on top of it that is activated by a ReLU activation function (`'relu'`). This model has not been tuned for high accuracy—the goal of this tutorial is to show a standard approach.

"""The plots show that training accuracy and validation accuracy are off by large margins, and the model has achieved only around 60% accuracy on the validation set.

Let's inspect what went wrong and try to increase the overall performance of the model.

## Overfitting

In the plots above, the training accuracy is increasing linearly over time, whereas validation accuracy stalls around 60% in the training process. Also, the difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is noticeable—a sign of [overfitting](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit).

When there are a small number of training examples, the model sometimes learns from noises or unwanted details from training examples—to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new examples. This phenomenon is known as overfitting. It means that the model will have a difficult time generalizing on a new dataset.

There are multiple ways to fight overfitting in the training process. In this tutorial, you'll use *data augmentation* and add *Dropout* to your model.

## Data augmentation

Overfitting generally occurs when there are a small number of training examples. [Data augmentation](./data_augmentation.ipynb) takes the approach of generating additional training data from your existing examples by augmenting them using random transformations that yield believable-looking images. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.

You will implement data augmentation using the following Keras preprocessing layers: `tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip`, `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`, and `tf.keras.layers.RandomZoom`. These can be included inside your model like other layers, and run on the GPU.
"""

    layers.RandomZoom(0.1),

    plt.imshow(augmented_images[0].numpy().astype("uint8"))
    plt.axis("off")

"""You will use data augmentation to train a model in a moment.

## Dropout

Another technique to reduce overfitting is to introduce [dropout](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#dropout_regularization) regularization to the network.

When you apply dropout to a layer, it randomly drops out (by setting the activation to zero) a number of output units from the layer during the training process. Dropout takes a fractional number as its input value, in the form such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, etc. This means dropping out 10%, 20% or 40% of the output units randomly from the applied layer.
